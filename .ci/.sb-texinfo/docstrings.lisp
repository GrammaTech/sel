;;;; A docstring extractor for the SBCL. Creates @include-ready documentation
;;;; from the docstrings of exported symbols of specified packages.

;;;; This software is part of the SBCL software system. SBCL is in the public
;;;; domain and is provided with absolutely no warranty. See the COPYING file
;;;; for more information.

;;;; TODO
;;;; * Verbatim text
;;;; * Quotations
;;;; * Method documentation untested
;;;; * Method sorting, somehow
;;;; * Index for macros & constants?
;;;; * This is getting complicated enough that tests would be good
;;;; * Nesting (currently only nested itemizations work)
;;;; * doc -> internal form -> texinfo (so that non-texinfo format are also
;;;;   easily generated)

;;;; FIXME: The description below is no longer complete. This
;;;; should possibly be turned into a contrib with proper documentation.

;;;; Formatting heuristics (tweaked to format SAVE-LISP-AND-DIE sanely):
;;;;
;;;; Formats SYMBOL as @code{symbol}, or @var{symbol} if symbol is in
;;;; the argument list of the defun / defmacro.
;;;;
;;;; Lines starting with * or - that are followed by intented lines
;;;; are marked up with @itemize.
;;;;
;;;; Lines containing only a SYMBOL that are followed by indented
;;;; lines are marked up as @table @code, with the SYMBOL as the item.
