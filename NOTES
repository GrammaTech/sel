** an option for containing the execution of evolved variants
http://lxc.sourceforge.net/
** when failing and running interactively, try to output errors from test.sh
So often we start to debug the framework, when the bug is in test.sh.

** ensure mutation operations can be reapplied
So if say we know that a program was crossed over at point x, we
should be able to call crossover(x) separate form the whole evolution
framework.

** objects generalizations and interactions

:                   evaluation                             version control

** thread local global variables
In case we want to run multiple populations in separate threads.

This should be easy with =let= binding of global variables.

** remember the need to collect statistics
- number of test suite evaluations
- time spent in many different aspects of the program, e.g.,
  - compilation
  - test suite evaluation
  - mutation and population maintenance
  - total run time

** consider how weighted path information propagates with mutation operators
Each individual should have its own weight, possibly expressed as a
diff against some global weight.

Even better, we can just store each individuals weight as part of its
genome.  If memory does become an issue then diff fanciness can be
brought to bear later on.

** possibly re-calculate the weighted path with each test case run
Nope, this would involve instrumenting each individual at the AST
level, and would require multiple runs for sampling at the ASM/ELF
levels, better to just use a heuristic to update/maintain weights.

e.g., weight of a recently transplanted piece of code is equal to the
average of previous weight and weight of both new neighbors.

See the =*genome-averaging-keys*= variable.

** allow adding individuals on-the-fly
Implement all operations as one-offs against a local =*population*=, a
la [[http://cs.unm.edu/~treport/tr/11-04/paper-2011-01.pdf][PEC]].

** as basis for distributed GP repair
See above, shouldn't be too difficult.  Loosely follow the PEC
algorithm.

** timed EC operators at set frequencies
One frequency options should be "fast as possible", but allowing
frequencies could be good for known energy consumption (e.g., if
running on someone's phone).

** external lisp runner
Executable as a shell script.
#+begin_src lisp
(defun main (argv)
  (format t "~a~%"
          (eval (read-from-string
                 (if (third argv)
                     (progn (load (second argv)) (third argv))
                     (second argv))))))

* Tasks [19/21]
** DONE allow multiple mutations
=*mut-chance*= -> =*mut-rate*=

** DONE better edit handling
Nothing is better than nothing, just dropped it entirely, easy for
users to add on their own with something like the following.

#+begin_src lisp
  (defmethod apply-mutate :around ((soft software-subclass-w-edits) op)
    (push op (edits soft))
    (call-next-method))
#+end_src

** DONE crossover and mutation should not be mutually exclusive
Change this logic in the `new-individual' and related functions.

** DONE fine tunable selection and eviction
There should be separate tournament sizes for selection and eviction.

To make `evolve' more of a classic /steady-state/ algorithm one would
have rank-based selection and eviction.

For now we could just make eviction and selection both controllable
through the tournament size, with a size of 1 being completely random.

** DONE expose a software-evolution utility class
** DONE cleanup files system [4/4]
- [X] combine soft.lisp and genome.lisp
- [X] use full names
- [X] remove the zmq-specific packaging and asd file
- [X] directory for evolutionary strategies?

** DONE switch soft-asm from lists to vectors
This will free up lists for CL source code.

** DONE Flesh out the test suite [4/4]
- [X] mutation operators
- [X] copy returns a *new* and *equal* object
- [X] fitness evaluation
- [X] population addition and subtraction

** DONE implement general tree-base operations
** DONE implement general list-based operations
** DONE fix bugs in list-based genome
- setf doesn't seem to have any effect because it is called on the
  constant data held in the variable rather than the variable itself

** DONE add a lisp source-code level representation
Should be able to repair the gcd algorithm.
file:test/gcd/repair-lisp.lisp

** DONE fix more bugs in lisp repair
it looks like evaluation and mutation and crossover are all throwing
errors, many of which are caused by that which should be a list not
being a list.

many `handler-case' statements are sprinkled through the code, update
these to write out offending genomes and functions to files for use in
future test cases

** DONE ensure that all proper lists stay proper lists in list genome mutation
** DONE add elf level representation
** test external script repair at all three levels
** CANCELED add an =optimize= evolutionary method

** TODO look at interactive evolution of individual CL functions
The idea being to support an interactive development environment in
which the developer starts by associating some conditions with a
function, probably best to use a macro

Just another =defmethod= on the =crossover= generic function.

** DONE integrate with LLVM
   - State "CANCELED"   from "TODO"       [2012-02-23 Thu 18:46] \\
     better (for now) to integrate with CLANG

This was done using an external command line interface.

*** Notes on FFI integration
see
- http://llvm.org/
- http://www.cliki.net/LLVM
- https://github.com/sellout/CL-LLVM -- install with quicklisp and
  work through the lisp version of the LLVM tutorial

Then look at [[http://llvm.org/docs/WritingAnLLVMPass.html][How to write a Pass]] for implementing this entire
technique as a compiler pass -- should have AST/IR manipulation in
there as well.

For parsing and manipulating LLVM IR, see [[http://stackoverflow.com/questions/9160509/how-do-i-parse-llvm-ir][how-do-i-parse-llvm-ir]].

** CANCELED parse C source code
   - State "CANCELED"   from "TODO"       [2012-06-20 Wed 14:24] \\
     nope, use an extant library
There is a lisp/YACC parser named =parcl= which uses yacc see
http://common-lisp.net/~sionescu/misc/parcl.tar.gz.

It works but isn't robust to stuff like comments or #include
directives.

Probably the most robust solution is to [[id:5291eb9c-6abd-4265-a7b5-f182cf317d6c][integrate with CLANG]].
