SEL Python API
==============

The SEL package provides a Python API into GrammaTech's Software
Evolution Library for source code manipulation.  SEL generalizes over
GitHub's tree-sitter parsing libraries providing a uniform interface
that generalizes across multiple programming languages, and providing
additional functionality for software inspection and modification.

Currently SEL requires the following:
- [tree-sitter][] and tree-sitter libraries for all languages of
  interest.  See [tree-sitter-install][] for installation information.
