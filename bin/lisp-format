;;; Commentary:
;;;
;;; This lisp-format script aims to provide the same functionality as
;;; clang-format only for lisp languages instead of for C languages.
;;; Emacs is used to perform formatting.  The behavior of clang-format
;;; is followed as closely as possible with the goal of a direct drop
;;; in replacement in most contexts.
;;;
;;; This script is suitable for (re)formatting lisp code using an
;;; external process.  This script may be marked as executable and
;;; executed directly on the command line as follows.
;;;
;;;     chmod +x lisp-format
;;;     ./lisp-format -h
;;;
;;; This script is appropriate for use in git commit hooks.  In fact
;;; the git-clang-format script [1] may be trivially converted into a
;;; git-lisp-format script as follows.
;;;
;;;     cat git-clang-format \
;;;         |sed 's/clang-format/lisp-format/g;s/clangFormat/lispFormat/' \
;;;         > git-lisp-format
;;;
;;;     # find the definition of "default_extensions" and change to:
;;;     #      default_extensions = ','.join(['lisp','cl','asd','scm','el'])
;;;
;;;     chmod +x git-lisp-format
;;;
;;; After the resulting git-lisp-format is added to your path then git
;;; can execute this file by running "git lisp-format."
;;;
;;; See [2] for an example description of a work flow leveraging git
;;; hooks and git-clang-format to ensure that code is well formatted
;;; before every commit (i.e., by adding [3] to an executable file
;;; named pre-commit in a repository's .git/hooks/ directory).  This
;;; work flow may be trivially adopted to use git-lisp-format for
;;; lispy code.
;;;
;;; Clang-format allows for customized "styles" to be specified by
;;; writing .clang-format files in the base of code repository and
;;; passing the -style=file flag to clang-format.  Lisp-format
;;; supports the same using .lisp-format files.  These files may hold
;;; arbitrary emacs-lisp code, and they will be loaded before every
;;; run of lisp-format.  An example file (which will load slime before
;;; indenting, assuming you have slime installed via quicklisp) is
;;; shown below.
;;;
;;;     ;;; -*- emacs-lisp -*-
;;;     (mapc (lambda (dir) (add-to-list 'load-path dir))
;;;           (directory-files (concat "~/quicklisp/dists/quicklisp/software/")
;;;                            t "slime-v*"))
;;;     (require 'slime)
;;;
;;; As described in the "git lisp-format -h" output, you can use "git
;;; config" to change the default style to "file" with the following
;;; command (run in a git repository).
;;;
;;;     git config lispFormat.style "file"
;;;
;;; Running the above and adding a .lisp-format file to the based of a
;;; git repository enables customization of the lisp-format behavior.

If no arguments are specified, it formats the code from standard input
and writes the result to the standard output.
If <file>s are given, it reformats the files. If -i is specified
together with <file>s, the files are edited in-place. Otherwise, the
result is written to the standard output.

USAGE: lisp-format [options] [<file> ...]

OPTIONS:
  -assume-filename=<string> - When reading from stdin, lisp-format assumes this
                              filename to look for a style config file (with
                              -style=file) and to determine the language.
  -fallback-style=<string>  - The name of the predefined style used as a
                              fallback in case lisp-format is invoked with
                              -style=file, but can not find the .lisp-format
                              file to use.
                              Use -fallback-style=none to skip formatting.
  -help                     - Display available options (-help-hidden for more)
  -i                        - Inplace edit <file>s, if specified.
  -length=<uint>            - Format a range of this length (in bytes).
                              Multiple ranges can be formatted by specifying
                              several -offset and -length pairs.
                              When only a single -offset is specified without
                              -length, lisp-format will format up to the end
                              of the file.
                              Can only be used with one input file.
  -lines=<string>           - <start line>:<end line> - format a range of
                              lines (both 1-based).
                              Multiple ranges can be formatted by specifying
                              several -lines arguments.
                              Can't be used with -offset and -length.
                              Can only be used with one input file.
  -offset=<uint>            - Format a range starting at this byte offset.
                              Multiple ranges can be formatted by specifying
                              several -offset and -length pairs.
                              Can only be used with one input file.
  -style=<string>           - Coding style, currently supports:
                                LLVM, Google, Chromium, Mozilla, WebKit.
                              Use -style=file to load style configuration from
                              .lisp-format file located in one of the parent
                              directories of the source file (or current
                              directory for stdin).
                              Use -style=\"{key: value, ...}\" to set specific
                              parameters, e.g.:
                                -style=\"{BasedOnStyle: llvm, IndentWidth: 8}\"
DEFERRED OPTIONS (maybe one day):
  -output-replacements-xml  - Output replacements as XML.
  -sort-includes            - If set, overrides the include sorting behavior
                              determined by the SortIncludes style flag
  -cursor=<uint>            - The position of the cursor when invoking
                              lisp-format from an editor integration
  -dump-config              - Dump configuration options to stdout and exit.
                              Can be used with -style option.
  -version                  - Display the version of this program"))
