  (VARIANT MUT-INFO) -- Symbols for variant and mut-info resulting from STEP
  TEST ---------------- Test function used to `evaluate' every VARIANT.
  MAX-EVALS ----------- Maximum number of evaluations to perform.
  MAX-TIME ------------ Maximum time to run.
  PERIOD -------------- Period (in evals) at which to call PERIOD-FN.
  PERIOD-FN ----------- Function to call every Period evals.
  EVERY-PRE-FN -------- Function to call before every evaluation.
  EVERY-POST-FN ------- Function to call after every evaluation.
  FILTER -------------- Function to filter variants from BODY.
  ANALYZE-MUTATION-FN - Function to call to analyze mutation results

The following global variables are implicitly updated by this function
and should be dynamically bound to perform multiple different
simultaneous searches, `*running*', `*start-time*', `*fitness-evals*'.
The global variable `*target-fitness-p*' implicitly defines a stopping
criteria for this search."
