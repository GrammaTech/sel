;;; Functions to run multiple tasks (such as mutations and fitness

;;; * Job: a function which returns a series of Tasks, one Task each
;;;        time it is called. When the series is exhausted, it will
;;;        return NIL.
;;;
;;; * Task: a thin wrapper over a Lisp object (typically a SOFTWARE
;;;         instance, but could be anything).  The task can be used to
;;;         customize how to process the object after fitness testing
;;;         (basically a completion routine) and to customize how it
;;;         spins off child Jobs.
;;;
;;; * Worker: one or more Worker threads can be created to process
;;;           Jobs.  When all jobs are finished, all the Worker
;;;           threads will exit.  Therefore you create Jobs first,
;;;           then the Workers.
;;;
;;; @subsection Description
;;;
;;; A TASK is an operation to be performed by the multi-threaded
;;; TASK-RUNNER. A TASK can be customized by the client to generate
;;; a job (child series of tasks) by implementing the TASK-JOB method,
;;; and the code to be performed when processing a TASK is defined by the
;;; PROCESS-TASK method.
;;;
;;; A job is a Lisp function, which takes no arguments, and which will
;;; produce a TASK each time it is called, or NIL when all of its tasks are
;;; complete. Think of a job as a lazy sequence of TASK.
;;;
;;; TASK-RUNNER-JOBS is a stack of jobs. Worker threads will call the
;;; first job on the stack, and process the task returned.
;;;
;;; A task may add 1 or more jobs to the top of the stack, causing worker
;;; threads to immediately start processing those jobs since they are now
;;; higher on the stack and therefore have priority over other tasks.
;;;
;;; When the JOBS stack is empty/NIL, then all worker threads will exit.
;;;
;;; @subsection Example use
;;;
;;;     (setf *runner* (run-task (make-instance 'single-cut-all :object *orig*)
;;;                              10))
;;;      ;; When (task-runner-worker-count *runner*) = 0,
;;;      ;; it means all threads are finished.
;;;
;;; @subsection Complex Example use
;;;

;;;       "Run FUNCTION over SEQUENCE using a `simple-job' `task-job'."

;;;
;;; The above example uses the tasks API to implement a simple
;;; parallel map spread across a configurable number of workers.  When
;;; more than one worker thread is requested the following objects and
;;; methods are created to implement the parallel map.
;;;
;;; * A TASK-MAP TASK is created to hold the sequence.
;;;
;;; * The TASK-JOB method is defined for this TASK-MAP.  This method
;;;   returns a function which has access to the SEQUENCE in a
;;;   closure.  The function will continually pop the first element
;;;   off the top of the sequence and wrap it in a TASK-ITEM object to
;;;   be returned until the SEQUENCE is empty at which point the
;;;   function returns nil causing all worker threads to exit.
;;;
;;; * The TASK-ITEM TASK is created to hold tasks for every item in
;;;   the sequence.
;;;
;;; * The PROCESS-TASK method is defined for this TASK-ITEM.  This
;;;   method evaluates the function stored in the TASK-OBJECT of this
;;;   TASK-ITEM and saves the result into the task runner's results.
;;;
;;; Finally, with the above objects and methods defined, the TASK-MAP
;;; macro wraps the sequence into a TASK-MAP TASK object and passes
;;; this to the RUN-TASK-AND-BLOCK function yielding a runner and the
;;; contents of that runner are extracted and returned using the
;;; TASK-RUNNER-RESULTS accessor.
;;;
;;; See the actual implementation of TASK-MAP in the SEL/UTILITY
;;; package for a more efficient implementation which doesn't use a
;;; macro or require new objects and methods to be defined on the fly.
