SEL is a Lisp @emph{package}, in essence, a container for symbols
allowing the creation of separate namespaces within a program. See
@url{http://www.gigamonkeys.com/book/programming-in-the-large-packages-and-symbols.html}
for more information on the definition and use of packages in Common
Lisp.

Conceptually the SEL API may be organized into the following topic
areas.  Every section below supports the core SEL uses of defining
software objects, operating on software objects, and defining useful
auxiliary structures such as test suites for manipulating software
objects.
