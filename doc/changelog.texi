SEL will use @url{https://semver.org/,semantic versioning} to
determine increments to version numbers.  This ChangeLog will be
roughly organized as described at
@url{https://keepachangelog.com/en/0.3.0/,Keep a ChangeLog}.  Most
importantly every version will include at least one ChangeLog entry,
and the entries will be sorted in reverse chronological order with the
most recent at the top.  Every entry will be named and indexed by date
and version number.  Working notes may be accumulated in a special
``Unreleased'' section at the top of the ChangeLog.
