SEL will use @url{https://semver.org/,semantic versioning} to
determine increments to version numbers.  This ChangeLog will be
roughly organized as described at
@url{https://keepachangelog.com/en/0.3.0/,Keep a ChangeLog}.  Most
importantly every version will include at least one ChangeLog entry,
and the entries will be sorted in reverse chronological order with the
most recent at the top.  Every entry will be named and indexed by date
and version number.  Working notes may be accumulated in a special
``Unreleased'' section at the top of the ChangeLog.

@itemize

@item @b{Change @code{build-target} to @code{artifacts}}

Changed the software @code{project} class as well as
@code{clang-project} and @code{java-project} to replace the
@code{build-target} field with a @code{artifacts} field.  This changes
what was previously a single string to a list of strings so that
projects may now build multiple artifacts (e.g., an executable and
multiple libraries).  This also changes the use of the project
@code{build-command}.  Previously the @code{build-target} was appended
to the @code{build-command} as a target, now the @code{build-command}
should be self-contained and will be run as is.
