The following code will enable multi-objective optimization:

@verbatiminclude ./examples/005-multi-objective.lisp

@code{#'pareto-selector} compares each candidate against a random
comparison set, preferring candidates which dominate the comparison
set. This will select for individuals along the Pareto front of the
population.

Because dominance is a partial order, @code{#'pareto-selector} will
often produce multiple winners. @code{#'pick-least-crowded} breaks
those ties based on @dfn{crowding distance}, a fitness-sharing metric
which promotes diversity by selecting individuals that are farther
from their neighbors in fitness space.

Multi-objective fitness scores should be lists with one value for each
objective. These lists must be the same length across the entire
population. The same @code{*fitness-predicate*} applies to all
objectives. It is not possible to maximize some objectives while
minimizing others.


@anchor{lexicase-selection}
@section Lexicase Selection
Lexicase selection is a form of multi-objective optimization which
prioritizes objectives in a different order for each selection
event. It can be enabled by setting @code{*tournament-selector*} to
@code{#'lexicase-select-best}.

Lexicase fitness scores are vectors of numeric values.

@code{#'pareto-selector} also supports lexicase selection for
individual objectives.
