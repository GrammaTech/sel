;; Automatic helper function generation
;;
;; When a repair requires moving or inserting multiple related
;; statements, and no single mutation improves fitness in isolation, a
;; standard genetic search has a low probability of succeeding. We can
;; alleviate this problem by automatically creating helper functions from
;; groups of related statements, and adding calls to those functions to
;; the fodder database.
;;
;; This file implements a simple approach to helper function generation,
;; based on n-grams extracted from execution traces.
