;;; fix-comp --- Functions to fix software object compilation

;;; Commentary:

;; The `fix-compilation' function will take a software object and will
;; try to make any changes necessary for that object to compile
;; successfully.  This will first employ `clang-tidy' (which calls the
;; command line utility of the same name).  If that is not sufficient
;; it will then begin collecting compilation error messages, and
;; calling the associated element of `*compilation-fixers*'.
;;
;; The `*compilation-fixers*' will be an alist of compiler warning
;; regular expressions, and associated functions to call over the
;; match data returned by the regular expression match.  Each fixer
;; function may modify its argument, and should return non-nil on
;; success or nil if additional fixers should be applied.
;;
;; NOTE: If this is every productized, it may be worthwhile
;; re-implementing it inside of clang-tidy, which does have an
;; extensible mechanism for adding additional fixers.
