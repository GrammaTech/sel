;;;; super-mutant.lisp --- evaluate multiple mutants in a single
;;;
;;; For many software objects, a large portion of the search time will
;;; be spent on compiling mutants in order to test their fitness. This
;;; overhead can be reduced significantly through the use of
;;; super-mutants, which bundle multiple changes into a single genome,
;;; guarded by runtime flags. This allows several mutants to be
;;; evaluated with a single compilation.
;;;
;;; Super-mutants can be enabled with the :SUPER-MUTANT-COUNT argument
;;; to EVOLVE. When this is greater than one, each iteration of the
;;; search loop will generate the indicated number of mutants. The
;;; mutants will then be combined into a super-mutant, producing a
;;; single phenome which is used to evaluate all variants.
;;;
;;; This process is almost entirely transparent to the client
;;; code. The callback functions EVERY-PRE-FN, EVERY-POST-FN and
;;; FILTER will be called individually on each mutant. The TEST
;;; function will also be called on each variant, but calls to PHENOME
;;; will return a wrapper which invokes the super-mutant with the
;;; desired mutations enabled.
;;;
;;; Super-mutants are currently only implemented for the specific
;;; software objects mentioned in the following subsections of this
;;; section.
;;;
;;; @node Clang Super-Mutants, ASM Super-Mutants, Super-Mutants, Super-Mutants
;;; @subsection Clang Super-Mutants
;;; @cindex clang-super-mutants
;;;
;;; Super mutants composed of CLANG and CLANG-PROJECT software objects
;;; work by combining the genomes of multiple objects into a single
;;; software object, identifying functions with differences between
;;; objects, and wrapping the bodies of those functions in SWITCH
;;; statements switching on the value of an environment variable which
;;; controls which mutant is exercised in any given execution.
;;;
;;; @subsubsection Interactions Between Mutants
;;;
;;; When combining multiple genomes, there is some risk of
;;; interactions between the individual mutants. These primarily
;;; relate to compilation errors. For example, if a mutation deletes a
;;; global variable which is referenced in the program, that would
;;; normally lead to an error. But if that mutant is combined with
;;; another which still has the variable, the combined mutant will
;;; compile and both will run as if the variable was present.
;;;
;;; Conversely, a compilation error in any mutant will cause
;;; compilation to fail for the entire super-mutant.
;;;
;;; If all mutants are free from compilation errors, their combination
;;; should also compile, and its runtime behavior should be
;;; functionally indistinguishable from that of the individual
;;; mutants.
;;;
;;; @subsubsection Performance Considerations
;;;
;;; The super-mutant genome will introduce a GETENV call and a SWITCH
;;; statement. If these are placed in a performance-critical function,
;;; execution time might increase significantly. If execution time is
;;; part of the fitness evaluation, use super-mutants with caution.
;;;
;;; A compilation failure in a single mutant will cause PHENOME to
;;; fail for the entire super-mutant. If mutations frequently
;;; introduce compilation failures, this can lead to a lot of wasted
;;; compilation. This problem will get worse as :SUPER-MUTANT-COUNT
;;; increases.
;;;
;;; Similarly, if the individual mutants are not compatible (due to
;;; differences in global variables or function signatures), a MUTATE
;;; error will be raised and the entire super-mutant discarded. This
;;; can lead to wasted mutations.
