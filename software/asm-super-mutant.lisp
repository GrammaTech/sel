;;; asm-super-mutant.lisp --- SUPER-MUTANT for single assembly functions
;;;
;;; @subsection ASM-SUPER-MUTANT Overview
;;;
;;; ASM-SUPER-MUTANT software objects are designed to provide the
;;; benefits of SUPER-MUTANT to assembly programs.  Its primary
;;; advantage is the ability to evaluate the fitness of large numbers
;;; of variants of a given target function, in a single process, in a
;;; minimal amount of time.  Avoiding the per-process overhead in
;;; fitness evaluations results in orders-of-magnitude improvements of
;;; efficiency.
;;;
;;; The ASM-SUPER-MUTANT has been tested with AT&T and Intel syntax
;;; and for nasm (Intel) and gas (AT&T) assemblers. Like ASM-HEAP,
;;; it won't work for arbitrary macro-heavy assembler code.
;;;
;;; The ASM-SUPER-MUTANT derives from an ASM-HEAP and also
;;; contains the SUPER-MUTANT methods.
;;;
;;; The ASM-SUPER-MUTANT initially contains a complete program
;;; executable (initialized from an asm format file).  In addition it
;;; contains a specification of a target function within the overall
;;; program.  The target function (specified either by name or as
;;; start and end addresses) is used to mark a range of lines within
;;; the overall program (returned by CREATE-TARGET).
;;;
;;; Like a SUPER-MUTANT, the ASM-SUPER-MUTANT maintains a collection
;;; of MUTANTS, each one being an instance of the ASM-HEAP software
;;; object.  Each MUTANT is a variant of the target function.
;;;
;;; @subsection Fitness Evaluation
;;;
;;; To perform fitness evaluation, the ASM-SUPERMUTANT performs the
;;; following steps:
;;;
;;; * The MUTANTS are combined into a single assembly file (.asm),
;;;   which also includes the data sections and declarations necessary
;;;   to be able to assemble. Every MUTANT is given a unique label
;;;   (variant_0, (variant_1, ... variant_n), and those labels are
;;;   exported.
;;;
;;; * Input/output data, see @pxref{i-o-file-format, I/O File Format},
;;;   is appended to the asm file, and is used to determine fitness of
;;;   each variant.  A set of I/O data (memory and register contents)
;;;   is provided for each test run of the target function.
;;;
;;; * The .asm file is assembled with NASM.
;;;
;;; * A C harness file (asm-super-mutant-fitness.c), which runs and
;;;   evaluates variants, is compiled and linked to the compiled
;;;   object file.  The C code provides functions to set up each test,
;;;   execute each variant, calculate the variant's fitness and
;;;   aggregate results.  Currently the fitness is set to the number
;;;   of executed instructions as collected by the linux Performance
;;;   Application Programming Interface (PAPI)
;;;   (@url{http://icl.utk.edu/papi/}) using the PAPI_TOT_INS event.
;;;   The harness contains some sandboxing code to handle differences
;;;   in execution address of the original test runs and the fitness
;;;   runs, manage heap memory pages, and trap and handle segment
;;;   violations and function crashes.
;;;
;;; * Each variant is assigned an array of fitness results, with each
;;;   item in in the array representing the number of instructions
;;;   required to execute the function on a given test run (i.e., I/O
;;;   pair).  If the variant did not properly pass the tests (I/O data
;;;   did not match) then MAXINT is assigned as the fitness variable
;;;   for that test run (since smaller is better, this is the worst
;;;   possible fitness).
;;;
;;; * The fitness harness writes an array of all test results for all
;;;   variants to the *STANDARD-OUTPUT* stream.
;;;
;;; * The compiled/linked fitness executable is executed by the
;;;   fitness test and the results (written to *STANDARD-OUTPUT*) are
;;;   parsed and stored in Lisp data structures (as an array of
;;;   arrays). This is cached on the ASM-SUPER-MUTANT instance, and
;;;   can be obtained with the FITNESS method.
;;;
;;; @subsection Tool Dependencies
;;;
;;; The ASM-SUPER-MUTANT currently depends upon:
;;; * Nasm to assemble the generated fitness program
;;; * Clang (version 6 or later) to compile and link the fitness program.
;;; * Assembly code or a high quality lifter (e.g., GrammaTech's
;;;   CodeSurfer for Binaries) to disassemble an original binary
;;;   program.
;;; * A method of collecting binary I/O pairs from a series of dynamic
;;;   tests in the format described below,
;;;   @pxref{i-o-file-format, I/O File Format}
;;;
;;; The ASM-HEAP, which is the basis for ASM-SUPER-MUTANT and all its
;;; variants, uses Intel-format assembly code (Nasm-compatible).
;;; In the near future we are planning to switch to AT&T assembler syntax
;;; and to replace Nasm with a more efficient assembler.
;;;
;;; @anchor{i-o-file-format}
;;; @subsection I/O File Format
;;;
;;; The file is ASCII.  In internal tests it s generated using the IBM
;;; PIN tool to observe the execution of a binary program on a test
;;; suite.
;;;
;;; An I/O file contains 1 or more test runs, and each test run
;;; comprises 2 sections: Input Data and Output Data.
;;;
;;; The format of Input Data is identical to Output Data, except that
;;; the set of registers that are included may differ.
;;;
;;; Each section (Input Data or Output Data) contains a section of
;;; register lines, followed by a section of memory lines.
;;;
;;; In the register section, the values of all significant registers
;;; are specified, one per line. This includes general-purpose
;;; registers (GPR) i.e. rax rbx, etc. followed by floating-point
;;; registers ymm0-15.
;;;
;;; Following the registers are values of relevant memory
;;; addresses. These include any memory addresses read or written by
;;; the function being tested.  If the function depends on a global
;;; variable for instance, it will be included.
;;;
;;; In the first section (registers) each line contains:
;;; * The name of the register, followed by the bytes in big-endian order,
;;; * The register name is separated from the bytes by whitespace, but any
;;;   other whitespace on the line should be ignored.
;;;
;;; For example, the line,
;;;
;;;     %rax    00 00 00 00 00 00 01 00
;;;
;;; indicates that register rax should contain the value 256.
;;;
;;; For the general-purpose registers rax, rcx, rdx, rbx, rsp, rbp,
;;; rsi, rdi, r8, r9, r10, r11, r12, r13, r14, and r15, all eight
;;; bytes will be explicitly included on the line.  For the SIMD
;;; registers ymm0-ymm15, all 32 bytes will be explicit.
;;;
;;; Memory would be specified with one 8-byte long per line, in
;;; big-endian order, consisting of an address, followed by a mask
;;; indicating which bytes are live, followed by the bytes
;;; themselves. The mask would be separated from the address and bytes
;;; by whitespace, but again any other whitespace on the line should
;;; be ignored.
;;;
;;; For example, the line,
;;;
;;;     00007fbb c1fcf768   v v v v v v v .   2f 04 9c d8 3b 95 7c 00
;;;
;;; indicates that the byte at address 0x7fbbc1fcf768 has value 0x00,
;;; the byte at 0x7fbbc1fcf769 has value 0x7c, and so forth
;;; (big-endian order).  Note that bytes 0x7fbbc1fcf769-0x7fbbc1fcf76f
;;; are live (indicated with "v") while 0x7fbbc1fcf768 is not
;;; (indicated with ".").
;;;
;;; @subsection Components
;;;
;;; ASM-SUPER-MUTANT software object consists of:
;;;
;;; * The ASM-HEAP, which is typically based on a file of assembly
;;;   source code.  The ASM-SUPER-MUTANT object contains the whole original
;;;   binary application (in assembler source format).
;;;
;;; * Input/output specifications, in a specific file format as
;;;   generated using the Intel monitoring application and our Python
;;;   scripts
;;;
;;; * Data object original addresses ("sanity file").
;;;
;;; * Function boundary deliminators which determines the target of
;;;   the mutation and evaluation.
;;;
;;; Note that the struct INPUT-SPECIFICATION is a bit of a misnomer as
;;; it is used here for both input specification and output
;;; specification (their formats are identical so we use the same
;;; struct for both).
;;;
;;; SUPER-MUTANT slots:
;;; * MUTANTS will contain a list of ASM-HEAP objects.
;;; * SUPER-SOFT caches a combined ASM-HEAP representing the output
;;;   fitness program.
;;; * PHENOME-RESULTS caches the results obtained from calling the PHENOME
;;;   method.
;;;
;;; @subsection Current Limitations
;;;
;;; * Functions which use floating point data as input or outputs will
;;;   not evaluate correctly. The fitness file that is generated does
;;;   not yet handle @code{ymm0}-@code{ymm15} registers, which are used to
;;;   pass floating point values in x86_64 binaries.
;;; * Currently only leaf functions (functions which do not call any other
;;;   functions) are supported.
;;; * The fitness test program does not do full sandboxing. It does protect
;;;   against segment violations (those will typically result in a
;;;   +worst-c-fitness+ rating) but a function variant could potentially write
;;;   on other code or data without triggering a segment violation, and this
;;;   will not get trapped. When that happens it will possibly invalidate
;;;   further fitness tests, or cause the whole fitness program to crash,
;;;   resulting in all variants to come back as +worst-c-fitness+.
;;;
;;; @subsection Installing PAPI on Ubuntu
;;; Fitness evaluation requires the PAPI component and the Linux Perf
;;; functionality. Building the fitness evaluation program (on the fly
;;; during fitness evaluation) requires a C program to compile and link
;;; to PAPI. This also requires a .h file to compile.
;;;
;;; To install papi:
;;;
;;;      sudo apt-get install papi-tools
;;;
;;; To install perf:
;;;
;;;     sudo apt-get install linux-tools-common linux-tools-generic linux-tools-`uname -r`
;;;
;;; Perf requires system permission to run. In linux, the value in
;;; /proc/sys/kernel/perf_event_paranoid should be set to 1
;;; (Disallow CPU event access by users without CAP_SYS_ADMIN).
;;; This is typically set to 3 (maximum paranoia) by default.
;;;
;;; This can be accomplished with the following:
;;;   sudo sh -c 'echo 1 >/proc/sys/kernel/perf_event_paranoid'
;;;   sudo sysctl -w kernel.perf_event_paranoid=1
;;;
;;; It's also a good idea to turn off randomizing of address base
;;; (to get more consistency):
;;;   sudo sh -c 'echo 0 >/proc/sys/kernel/randomize_va_space'
;;;   sudo sysctl -w kernel.randomize_va_space=0
;;;
;;; To get necessary include (.h) file for compiling C harness with PAPI
;;; (needed to perform fitness evaluation):
;;;
;;;      sudo apt-get install libpapi-dev
;;;
;;; Then you should be able to enter
;;;
;;; papi_avail
;;;
;;; and see a list of available PAPI events.
;;; ASM-SUPER-MUTANT requires the use of the PAPI_TOT_INS event (total number
;;; of instructions executed).
;;; After installation, the PAPI library should be found in one of these
;;; locations:
;;;     /usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libpapi.so
;;;     /usr/lib/libpapi.so.5.6.1
