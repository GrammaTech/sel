;;; A `coq-project' object extends the main SEL `project' object. In addition to
;;; the SEL `project' fields, it includes an additional `project-file' field for
;;; storing the path to a _CoqProject file. (This is intentionally duplicated on
;;; `coq' objects, because having it stored at the project-level makes more
;;; sense for projects, while having it on individual `coq' objects allows them
;;; to function well outside of projects.)
