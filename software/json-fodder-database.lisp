  ;; It is assumed that all JSON databases will be fairly small;
  ;; otherwise, Mongo should be utilized.

  ;; memory footprint by stable sorting the ast-database-list first by
  ;; full-stmt and then by AST class.  We could keep an index where the full
  ;; statements end.  Additionally, we could keep indexes where each AST
  ;; class begins and ends.
