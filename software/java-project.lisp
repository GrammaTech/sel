;;; Specialization for building a software object from a java project
;;;
;;; Implements the core functionality of the software-evolution-library
;;; for class files written in java. The java versions that are supported
;;; relies heavily on an input's success of parsing individual files with
;;; @uref{http://javaparser.org/, Java Parser}.
;;;
;;; The project will use jar files to extract which files need to be
;;; initialized in this context. A java-project will contain relative
;;; path names and the corresponding software object, stored in
;;; evolve-files. Naturally, the java software object is used in this
;;; implementation.
;;;
;;; The core functionality is supported by the command line tool
;;; @uref{https://github.com/GrammaTech/java-mutator, java-mutator}.
;;;
;;; Note: certain methods in this class are over-loaded to provide consistency
;;; with other software objects, but are not used in this implementation.
