;;; coq.lisp --- Coq software representation
;;;
;;; @subsection Coq Module Organization
;;;
;;; The `coq' module is split into two layers. The lower layer, implemented in
;;; `serapi-io.lisp', is strictly responsible for serialization of Coq abstract
;;; syntax trees (ASTs) and is described in-depth in its own section.
;;;
;;; The `coq' and `coq-project' software objects, implemented in `coq.lisp' and
;;; `coq-project.lisp', respectively, are higher-level abstractions built on
;;; `serapi-io'. Ideally, clients should only have to construct software objects
;;;  and use API functions provided by `coq.lisp' or `coq-project.lisp' without
;;;  having to worry about the lower-level functions.
;;;
;;; @subsection Creating Coq Objects
;;;
;;; Coq software objects have the following fields:
;;;
;;; * PROJECT-FILE path to _CoqProject file
;;; * FILE-SOURCE path to the Coq source file this object represents
;;; * IMPORTS list of ASTs representing load or require statements
;;; * GENOME list of ASTs representing the Coq source, excluding imports
;;; * AST-IDS list of AST IDs assigned to ASTs in the genome
;;; * FITNESS fitness of the object last time it was evaluated
;;;
;;; The recommended way to create a Coq software object is using `from-file':
;;;
;;;     (with-serapi ()
;;;       (from-file (make-instance 'coq :project-file "/path/to/_CoqProject")
;;;                  "/path/to/Foo.v"))
;;;
;;; If you don't have a _CoqProject file, you may omit the `:project-file'
;;; keyword.
;;;
;;; Since many API functions require interactions with SerAPI, a `with-serapi'
;;; macro is provided to automatically create a sertop process. This works by
;;; binding the dynamic variable `*serapi-process*' to an interactive sertop
;;; process. This is important to be aware of if you intend to use multiple
;;; threads: each thread _must_ have its own separate sertop process (in
;;; bordeaux-threads this may be accomplished by creating thread-local copies
;;; with `*default-special-bindings*').
;;;
;;; Each `-I' or `-R' line in _CoqProject will be automatically added to the Coq
;;; loadpath in the sertop process. If a new sertop process is created, you must
;;; ensure that these load paths are reset and any imports are reloaded. You can
;;; do this with either `set-load-paths' (which only sets the load paths) or
;;; `reset-and-load-imports' (which in addition to setting load paths also
;;; executes import statements).
;;;
;;; @subsection Usage of Coq Objects
;;;
;;; The ASTs of a Coq genome are lists whose elements are lists, symbols, and
;;; strings. A `type-safe-swap' mutation selects two subtrees that have the same
;;; ``tag'' (i.e., the first symbol in that list) and swaps them. Favoring this
;;; mutation helps to cut down on type errors that would result from swapping
;;; arbitrary subtrees.
;;;
;;; Additional mutations are forthcoming.
;;;
;;; In the AST representations provided by Coq, many statements include location
;;; information tying AST nodes to locations in the source file. To help reduce
;;; the size of the AST, `from-file' replaces the full location information with
;;; the list `(:loc nil)'. This ensures that it's clear where the location
;;; information was without overly cluttering the AST. The implementation of
;;; `lookup-source-strings' ensures that these are removed prior to sending the
;;; ASTs to sertop to look up source strings. The default implementations of
;;; `pick-bad' and `pick-good' for Coq objects exclude ``located'' statements.
;;;
;;; Since sertop maintains a stateful representation of definitions that have
;;; been loaded and Coq prevents redefinition, it is sometimes necessary to
;;; reset the state of sertop to an earlier state. The easiest way to do this is
;;; to use `insert-reset-point' to indicate that you may later want to restore
;;; sertop to the current state, and `reset-serapi-process' to reset to a
;;; previously saved state. Both `from-file' and `reset-and-load-imports' insert
;;; a reset point before returning.
