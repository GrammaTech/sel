;;; diff.lisp --- Store genomes as differences against a reference genome
;;;
;;; Classes which inherit from diff will replace their genome structure
;;; with a diff which instead of holding a copy of the entire genome
;;; only holds a difference against a reference version of the genome.
;;; For example, the following will transparently save a single
;;; reference version of the genome and each individual in the
;;; population of `arm' objects will only hold a pointer to this single
;;; reference, and it's own diff against this single reference.
;;;
;;;    (defclass arm (software-evolution-library:diff elf-arm)
;;;      ((results :initarg :results :accessor results :initform nil)))
;;;
;;; After some initial experimentation, it does seem that mutations are
;;; now noticeably slower, because the differencing operations are not
;;; cheap.
