<h3 class="section">3.8 Super-Mutants</h3>
<a name="index-super_002dmutants"></a>

<p>For many software objects, a large portion of the search time will
be spent on compiling mutants in order to test their fitness. This
overhead can be reduced significantly through the use of
super-mutants, which bundle multiple changes into a single genome,
guarded by runtime flags. This allows several mutants to be
evaluated with a single compilation.
</p>
<p>Super-mutants can be enabled with the <code>:super-mutant-count</code> argument
to <code>evolve</code>. When this is greater than one, each iteration of the
search loop will generate the indicated number of mutants. The
mutants will then be combined into a super-mutant, producing a
single phenome which is used to evaluate all variants.
</p>
<p>This process is almost entirely transparent to the client
code. The callback functions <code>every-pre-fn</code>, <code>every-post-fn</code> and
<code>filter</code> will be called individually on each mutant. The <code>test</code>
function will also be called on each variant, but calls to <code>phenome</code>
will return a wrapper which invokes the super-mutant with the
desired mutations enabled.
</p>
<a name="Limitations-1"></a>
<h4 class="subsection">3.8.1 Limitations</h4>

<ul>
<li> Super-mutants are currently only implemented for <code>clang</code> and
  <code>clang-project</code> software objects.

</li><li> Global variable declarations must match across all
  mutants. Declarations may be added or deleted, however.

</li><li> Functions must have identical arguments and return types across
  all mutants. Functions may be added or deleted, but all existing
  copies must match.


</li></ul>
<a name="Interactions-Between-Mutants"></a>
<h4 class="subsection">3.8.2 Interactions Between Mutants</h4>

<p>When combining multiple genomes, there is some risk of
interactions between the individual mutants. These primarily
relate to compilation errors. For example, if a mutation deletes a
global variable which is referenced in the program, that would
normally lead to an error. But if that mutant is combined with
another which still has the variable, the combined mutant will
compile and both will run as if the variable was present.
</p>
<p>Conversely, a compilation error in any mutant will cause
compilation to fail for the entire super-mutant.
</p>
<p>If all mutants are free from compilation errors, their combination
should also compile, and its runtime behavior should be
functionally indistinguishable from that of the individual
mutants.
</p>
<a name="Performance-Considerations"></a>
<h4 class="subsection">3.8.3 Performance Considerations</h4>

<p>The super-mutant genome will introduce a <code>getenv</code> call and a <code>switch</code>
statement. If these are placed in a performance-critical function,
execution time might increase significantly. If execution time is
part of the fitness evaluation, use super-mutants with caution.
</p>
<p>A compilation failure in a single mutant will cause <code>phenome</code> to
fail for the entire super-mutant. If mutations frequently
introduce compilation failures, this can lead to a lot of wasted
compilation. This problem will get worse as <code>:super-mutant-count</code>
increases.
</p>
<p>Similarly, if the individual mutants are not compatible (due to
differences in global variables or function signatures), a <code>mutate</code>
error will be raised and the entire super-mutant discarded. This
can lead to wasted mutations.
