<span id="Clang-Super_002dMutants-1"></span><h4 class="subsection">3.5.1 Clang Super-Mutants</h4>
<span id="index-clang_002dsuper_002dmutants"></span>

<p>Super mutants composed of <code>clang</code> and <code>clang-project</code> software objects
work by combining the genomes of multiple objects into a single
software object, identifying functions with differences between
objects, and wrapping the bodies of those functions in <code>switch</code>
statements switching on the value of an environment variable which
controls which mutant is exercised in any given execution.
</p>
<span id="Interactions-Between-Mutants"></span><h4 class="subsubsection">3.5.1.1 Interactions Between Mutants</h4>

<p>When combining multiple genomes, there is some risk of
interactions between the individual mutants. These primarily
relate to compilation errors. For example, if a mutation deletes a
global variable which is referenced in the program, that would
normally lead to an error. But if that mutant is combined with
another which still has the variable, the combined mutant will
compile and both will run as if the variable was present.
</p>
<p>Conversely, a compilation error in any mutant will cause
compilation to fail for the entire super-mutant.
</p>
<p>If all mutants are free from compilation errors, their combination
should also compile, and its runtime behavior should be
functionally indistinguishable from that of the individual
mutants.
</p>
<span id="Performance-Considerations"></span><h4 class="subsubsection">3.5.1.2 Performance Considerations</h4>

<p>The super-mutant genome will introduce a <code>getenv</code> call and a <code>switch</code>
statement. If these are placed in a performance-critical function,
execution time might increase significantly. If execution time is
part of the fitness evaluation, use super-mutants with caution.
</p>
<p>A compilation failure in a single mutant will cause <code>phenome</code> to
fail for the entire super-mutant. If mutations frequently
introduce compilation failures, this can lead to a lot of wasted
compilation. This problem will get worse as <code>:super-mutant-count</code>
increases.
</p>
<p>Similarly, if the individual mutants are not compatible (due to
differences in global variables or function signatures), a <code>mutate</code>
error will be raised and the entire super-mutant discarded. This
can lead to wasted mutations.
